## Purpose

The purpose of this document is twofold. 

 1. to demonstrate how Rmardown can help you to compile a report while you are coding a project

 2. to provide the basic structure of a Markov Switching Model (MSM)

Before we begin, it is important to note the file structure of this project. You will notice that there is a .Rproj file. This serves as a project environment which contains all the folders and files associated with this project. This file structure is useful when there are many moving parts that need to be combined into one chronological and comprehensive workflow. 

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see the [Rmarkdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

### Markov Switching Model: two regimes

Let us begin by cleaning the global environment, loading all the necessary packages and functions, and preparing the data that will be used. We do not want code to appear in the final document and so use the command include=FALSE for the chunk below. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)

pacman::p_load(modelsummary, gt, knitr, kableExtra, tidyvers)

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:

gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.

# ---------------------------------------- packages ------------------------------------------

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # use pacman to load in all the necessary packages for your project

pacman::p_load(MSwM, tidyverse) # load in the packages needed 


# ---------------------------------------- functions -----------------------------------------

list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.)) # load in any functions that have been created. These belong in the "code" folder and are written as separate scripts to keep their individual environments sanitized 

# ----------------------------------------- dada --------------------------------------------

# below create a random normal data set 
set.seed(51) 
n <- 300
np1 <- n+1
St <- c(rep(1,51),rep(2,20),rep(1,30),rep(2,30),rep(1,70),rep(2,10),rep(1,50),rep(2,20),rep(1,20))
zt <- runif(np1, min=0, max=1)  # regressor: create a uniform distribution 
at <- rnorm(np1)                # epsilon(t): a normal distribution



# set initial value
x <- at[1]                      # any random value assigned to 1


# function to specify switching 
for(i in 2:np1){
    tmp = 0
    if(is.na(1)){
        tmp = 2.0 + 0.8*x[i-1] + 1.5*at[i]
        }
    else{
        tmp = -2.0 + 0.6*zt[i]-0.8*x[i-1]+at[i]
        }
    x <- c(x,tmp)
    }


## Remove the initial value
xt <- x[-1]
zt <- zt[-1]
St <- St[-1] 

# bind xt, and zt into a data frame. Assing the value 1 to a new column as a constant
x <- cbind(xt,rep(1,300),zt) # Start model fitting
colnames(x) <- c("xt","cnst","zt")

```

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r df}
# ensure that your data is specified as a data frame 
X <- data.frame(x)

m1 <- lm(xt ~ -1 + cnst + zt, data=X) # regress xt on zt
summary(m1)

m2 <- msmFit(m1, k=2, p=1, sw=c(T,T,T,T))
summary(m2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plotDiag(m2) # Residual ACF and PACF
par(mfcol=c(2,1))


plotDiag(m2,which=1) # Residual plot
plotDiag(m2,which=2) # Q-Q plot of residuals

# to extract embeded calls in your model uncomment the below commands
# slotNames(m2)
# slotNames(m2@Fit)
# dim(m2@Fit@filtProb)

par(mfrow=c(2,1))

plot(m2@Fit@filtProb[,1],type='l',main='Filtered Probability Regime 1', ylab='prob',xlab='time')

plot(m2@Fit@smoProb[,2],type='l',main='Smoothed Probability Regime 2',ylab='prob',xlab='time')
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
